'''

Starting at the temperature for which an initial guess has been provided, the code below
will find the optimal parameters for that temperature. Those parameters will then be
used as an initial guess for the next temperature. It's possible to choose if the fitting
should start from the highest or lowest temperature available by setting ascending_order 
to True or False. 

A text file will be created in the working directory with the optimal parameters. 

In the working directory, two folders will be created. One with the plots of the initial 
guess and fit for each temperature and another with the permittivity for each temperature.

The name of the files with exp data MUST end in the following format:

    temperatureK.extension, where temperature must have 3 digits

For example, sample_004K.txt or sample_300K.txt
